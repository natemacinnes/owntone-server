# Getting started

After installation (see [Installation](installation.md)) do the following:

 1. Edit the configuration file (usually `/etc/owntone.conf`) to suit your
    needs
 2. Start or restart the server (usually `/etc/init.d/owntone restart`)
 3. Go to the web interface [http://owntone.local:3689](http://owntone.local:3689),
    or, if that won't work, to http://SERVER_ADDRESS:3689
 4. Wait for the library scan to complete
 5. If you will be using a remote, e.g. Apple Remote: Start the remote, go to
    Settings, Add Library
 6. Enter the pair code in the web interface (update the page with F5 if it does
    not automatically pick up the pairing request)
